UNIX/GIT Workshop Notes

git commands

git init -- initialize repository. Used from project directory that contains
  the files that will be tracked
git status --
git add 'filename'--adds a new file to be tracked, or stages a changed file to be
  committed
git commit -m"version notes"--pushes staged file to repo with notes on what was
  changed and why. also tracks who made the changes and when
git log--shows history of repo

Branched the unix/git notes. Mainly to explore the use of the branch/fork
process.

git is version control software. When you GIT INIT, git will create a repo and
start tracking all changes to the directory you are currently in. Once you
GIT ADD a file, git tracks all changes made to this file, and who made the
changes, and when. GIT COMMIT -m"version notes" will make a saved copy of the
current state of the file.
GIT BRANCH will fork the change path, so that multiple development paths can
be track at the same time.
CHECKOUT "branch" will move your current location (HEAD) to the branch, and
track changes from there.

Remote repo

github is a site for storing remote repos, which can then serve as a central
point to collaborate with other users, share your work, etc.
once you PUSH a change to github, your local git repo is copied to github
